                IMPLEMENT   The end of round ordering should be Score > Health > Income
                            This way the if the player loses we don't show Income screen
                            Instead show a game over screen followed by a tally of random stats
                            Potential Stats:
                                            Hands Won
                                            Most Gold Had
                                            Highest scoring round

                > Upon getting to 0 health or below go to Game Over Screen
                    > Show progress to next unlock
                    > Show close milestones, etc..
            > Implement 'Shoot the moon'
                > Allow players and CPUs to accomplish this
                    With the player getting rewarded with extra score and or multipliers
                    The amount of damage the player takes from the CPU Shooting the moon, should be sufficient for the downside
